I am covid free! (for now)

How’s this as a continuation of this mornings work?

OBJECTIVE
find ei.UUID for every record in id

where
id =  “SEGMENT”.“<SEGMENT_SCHEMA>“.”IDENTIFIES” 
ei: = STITCH_LANDING.ELLIS_ISLAND.USER
pu =  “SEGMENT”.“PERSONAS_THE_CHOSEN_WEB”.“USERS”
wt =  “STITCH_LANDING”.“CHOSENHYDRA”.“WATCHTIME”
and 
 <SEGMENT_SCHEMA> is any schema 
under the SEGMENT database 
that has an IDENTIFIES table
with non-null, USER_ID, RID, and EMAIL values

Three-phase attempt:

use id.USER_ID
id.UUID = id.USER_ID  % ei UUID

 2. use id.RID:
id.UUID = id.RID % wt.RID | wt.USER_ID % pu.ID -> ei.UUID

 3. use id.EMAIL:
id.UUID = id.EMAIL %  ei.USERNAME | ei.UUID

Where
xx.C | xx.D indicates that non-null column C in table xx has non-null column D in the same table
xx.A % yy.B indicates some percentage of non-null column A in table xx having a match with non-null column B in table yy

A version of phase 1 has been running for a few hours 
where id is all tables (not just IDENTIFIES) under SEGMENT that have
records with non-null ANONYMOUS_ID, USER_ID, and EMAIL values

breaking for dinner now.
